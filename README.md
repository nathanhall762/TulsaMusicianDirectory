# The Tulsa Musician Directory
https://tulsamusiciandirectory.web.app

Tulsa Musician Directory is a dynamic web application that puts Tulsa's vibrant music scene at your fingertips. Powered by a React front-end and a robust Firebase back-end, it serves as the ultimate resource for discovering local musicians and their talent. Our platform thrives on community contributions, allowing users to submit musician information while ensuring accuracy through meticulous admin verification.

Discover the heart and soul of Tulsa's music community through an extensive directory of artists and bands. With automatic music embeds, users can listen to music without leaving the page, and links provided lead to the artists' online presence. Each musician is presented through a user-friendly 'musician card' interface, offering a comprehensive Electronic Press Kit (EPK) experience, all without the artist having to create one themselves.

As we grow, our vision expands beyond Tulsa, with plans to make the Musician Directory easily adaptable to other cities and regions. All it takes is a dedicated team of admins and a touch of coding expertise, following the installation, usage, and configuration instructions we will eventually provide here.

Stay tuned for our upcoming discovery page, designed to help users explore and find new music by prompting them to search and select their favorite artists, resulting in a personalized directory sorted by recommendations.

Join us in celebrating the richness of local music, and we look forward to your contributions and feedback as we continue to enhance this platform.

## Features

### Automatic Music Embeds:

Experience seamless music discovery with our embedded music player. Listen to tracks from local musicians without the need to leave the page, creating an easily navigable discovery experience.

### Links to Musicians' Online Presence:

Follow and connect with musicians on their platforms by easily accessing their online presence through links provided on musician profiles that lead to their websites, social media profiles, and more.

### Upcoming Discovery Page (Coming Soon):

Our upcoming discovery page is designed to enable local music exploration. Simply search and select your favorite artists, and our platform will curate a personalized directory of local musicians based on your preferences, making it easier than ever to discover new talent.
